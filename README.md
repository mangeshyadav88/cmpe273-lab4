============

The goal of this lab is to understand how CRDT works and to implement a (POC) of CRDT.
We will be using the same three cache servers from the lab 2’s baseline. Since you don’t need to use any consistent hashing implementation in this assignment, you can start from the original baseline.

A: http://localhost:3000

B: http://localhost:3001

C: http://localhost:3002
